# copperCoilErasmusBulgary

This is the first program I made with @Dario-Rota during the ERASMUS in LMP industry (Plovdiv, Bulgary).

The goal was to fix some bugs on code written for an arduino board over a machine to wrap copper on a coil.

### **machine description:**

The way the machine wrap the copper on a coil is simple: the coil rotates on itself while a mechanical arm moves the wire from the left to the right and back.

Machine also has a button for starting and a button as a sensor for the position of the arm.
